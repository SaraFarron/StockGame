A little game i made to test my skills. You can buy and sell some stuff in it, and after every deal prices will randomly change
I'm a Russian student studying radiophysics in university right now. Learning c++ by myself. I'm inrested in microcontroller programming - i coded arduino a bit and plan to raise my skills in stm32. To improve my coding skills i upload my projects to GutHub and ask people to criticize it).
